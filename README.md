# Adult Mouse Leptomeninges Exhibit Regional and Age-related Cellular Heterogeneity Implicating Mental Disorders.
The leptomeninges envelop the central nervous system (CNS) and contribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and homeostasis. Analysis of the adult anterior and posterior mouse forebrain meninges by single nuclear RNA-sequencing (snucRNA-seq) revealed regional differences in fibroblast and endothelial cell composition and gene expression. Surprisingly, these non-neural cells co-expressed genes implicated in neural functions. The regional differences changed with aging from young (3 month) to old (18 month) animals. Cytokine analysis revealed specific soluble factor production from anterior and posterior meninges that altered with age. Anterior and posterior leptomeninges co-culture differentially impacted survival of anterior or posterior cortical neuronal subsets, neuron morphology and proliferation of glia, effects that were impaired with aging.  These findings suggest that meningeal dysfunction in different brain regions could contribute to specific neural pathology.  Disease associations of meningeal cell genes differentially expressed with region and age are significantly enriched for mental and substance abuse disorders.
